A simple personal website, using native HTML, CSS and Javascript to learn fundamental web developement concepts.


## General Information
```

I have always wanted to make my own website, so I figured that making a relatively simple website using native HTML, CSS and Javascript could be a great way to learn fundamental web developement concepts.

As I don't have anything in particular I'd want to do with the website, it mainly consists of random elements such as an introductory page, art gallery of my fursona and weather forecasts of various places. 

We'll see if I use this website for a specific purpose sometime later. But for now this is just a hobby project where I play around with web developement.

## Todo
```
Scale website correctly for use with mobile devices
Add a mobile navigation menu
Make the art gallery look more fancy
